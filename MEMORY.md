## Communication Protocol Override

- **ORION** is the only agent that communicates with you via Telegram.
- Specialist bots (ATLAS, NODE, etc.) do not send Telegram messages directly and operate via `/swarm-planner`, `/parallel-task`, and the `tasks/QUEUE.md` workflow.
- Team channel integration is paused until further notice.

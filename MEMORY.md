# Long-Term Memory

Use this file to record persistent notes, insights, and references that span multiple sessions.

## Agent Preferences

- Agents may run multiple rounds of patches and testing loops autonomously when implementing features, and only report back once those rounds are complete.
- When summarizing or coordinating work, explicitly mention relevant specialist agents (ATLAS, NODE, EMBER, PIXEL, LEDGER) as appropriate.
- Proactively notify via Telegram (text or TTS) whenever a background task fails or throws an exception.
- Do not accompany voice memos with full verbatim transcripts; summaries or omitting the transcript is preferred.
- Omit file citation markers like “【F:…】” from user‑facing replies unless explicitly asked.

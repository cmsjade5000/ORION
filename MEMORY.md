# Long-Term Memory

Use this file to record persistent notes, insights, and references that span multiple sessions.

## Agent Preferences

- Agents may run multiple rounds of patches and testing loops autonomously when implementing features, and only report back once those rounds are complete.
- When summarizing or coordinating work, explicitly mention relevant specialist agents (ATLAS, NODE, EMBER, PIXEL, LEDGER) as appropriate.

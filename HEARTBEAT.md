# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

# Heartbeat workflows are now defined in the workflow DSL:
See `workflows/heartbeat.yaml` for heartbeat workflow definitions, including schedules, retry/backoff policies, and failure alerts.

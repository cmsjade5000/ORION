# Side Hustle Plan

**Objective:** Find and set up a crypto wallet you fully control (able to deposit and withdraw).

I will fund it with $50 (no risk)—consider it an investment you manage. Use any strategy you like:

**Status:** FUNDED (~0.0263 ETH on Mainnet). Proceed to execution.

## Phase 2: Base Strategy Execution

**Status:** ACTIVE ON BASE (~0.02 ETH)

**Current Strategy:**
- Scan for high-yield stablecoin pairs or low-risk swaps on Base (e.g., Aerodrome, Uniswap).
- Execute small test trade to verify automation.

**Phase 2.1: Small Test Trade**
- Execute a minimal swap (0.001 ETH) for a stablecoin on Base to confirm end-to-end flow.

**Phase 2.2: Full Deployment**
- If test trade succeeds, resume full allocation of remaining funds.

*Let me know if the small test trade works.*

- Gas transaction funding
- Trading or swaps
- Yield strategies

Use other specialist agents (ATLAS, LEDGER, etc.) as needed. I’ll step in wherever help is required.

*Let me know if you have any questions before we begin.*

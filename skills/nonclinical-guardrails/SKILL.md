# Non-Clinical Guardrails (EMBER)

Use this skill when language suggests distress, overwhelm, panic, or safety risk. This is not medical or diagnostic guidance.

## Quick Triage Labels

- `red`: imminent danger or explicit self-harm intent, or not safe right now
- `yellow`: vague safety language, escalating panic, impulsive/risky actions likely
- `green`: stress/overwhelm but stable and oriented

## Red (Immediate Safety)

If `red`, prioritize a short safety script:
- Encourage contacting local emergency services now.
- US: call/text `988` (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline).
- Ask if they are in immediate danger and if someone can be with them.
- Do not debate or over-explain.
- Hand off to EMBER-focused support and keep it simple.

## Yellow (Stabilize + Reduce Risk)

If `yellow`, aim for:
- grounding (60 seconds)
- confirm basic safety
- one reversible next step
- postpone irreversible decisions

## Green (Support + Plan)

If `green`, do:
- normalize the stress response
- clarify triggers and constraints
- propose a small, reversible next step

## Stress-to-Decision Bridge (4 Steps)

1. Ground (30-60s): name 3 things you see, 2 you feel, 1 you hear; slow exhale.
2. Stakes: what happens if we do nothing for 2 hours? 24 hours?
3. Options: list 2-3 options, including a reversible one.
4. Next step: pick the smallest reversible action and a check-in time.

## Banned / Avoid

- diagnosis language
- “you should” directives that remove agency
- any claim of certainty about mental health conditions
- instructions that bypass safety steps when danger is present

# Intake (Append-Only)

This folder is for **raw incoming requests** before they become tickets.

Rules:
- Append-only: do not edit or delete old intake items; add follow-ups as new files.
- One request per file.
- Keep it short and factual; link to context if needed.

Recommended file naming:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>.md`

Flow:
- ORION triages intake items into normalized tickets in `tasks/WORK/backlog/`.

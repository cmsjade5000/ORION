# Work Lanes

This is the execution area for file-first tickets.

Quick lanes:
- `backlog/` normalized queue (ordered by ticket number)
- `in-progress/` active work
- `testing/` waiting on verification
- `done/` completed
- `assignments/` optional breadcrumbs (who is on what)
- `artifacts/` outputs (reports/logs/patches) keyed by ticket

See `tasks/TICKETS.md` for the spec.

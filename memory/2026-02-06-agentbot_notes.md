# Notes (2026-02-06)

- All agent @bots are currently unable to respond (‘fly’ state).
- ATLAS won’t be able to review directly; need to spin up a separate agent “as” ATLAS for review workflows.
- Otherwise, proceed to install the new skill (Agent Autonomy Kit) without ATLAS involvement.
- No actual Telegram bot representation of specialist agents; all agent interactions occur internally via ORION and @agent tags.

## Automated Dev Audit Pipeline

- Added helper scripts `scripts/cost_report.sh` (LLM cost report) and `scripts/infra_drift_check.sh` (infrastructure drift check).
- Configured `pulse.devAuditPipeline` in openclaw.yaml with cost thresholds and drift settings.
- Created `workflows/dev-audit-pipeline.yaml` to chain: Mino repo scan, skill-repo security audit, cost report, and infra drift check nightly at 03:30 UTC with retry/backoff and Telegram alerts.
- Updated `src/skills/pulse/README.md` with Dev Audit Pipeline configuration, schedule, sequence, and manual trigger (`demo:dev-audit-pipeline`).

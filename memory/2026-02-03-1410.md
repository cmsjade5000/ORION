## Conversation Summary

assistant: Let me know if you’d like me to probe for a repo link, search for documentation, or find an alternative companion project—we can dig deeper if it seems promising.
user: [Telegram Cory Stoner id:8471523294 +18s 2026-02-03 13:07 UTC] Install Crabwalk for me! https://crabwalk.app/skill be careful.
[message_id: 255]
assistant: It looks like the install script is prompting for `sudo` (for `qrencode`), which stalls in this environment. Since `qrencode` is optional for QR code display, I’ll rerun the install steps without that part. Shall I proceed with just the core Crabwalk installation (extracting the binary to `~/.local/bin`) and skip the QR dependency?

user: [Telegram Cory Stoner id:8471523294 +1m 2026-02-03 13:11 UTC] Since you are running in a UTMAPP Ubuntu server on a VM on Mac mini, will I be able to use the app on my Mac if you install it here?

Installing Crabwalk inside the Ubuntu VM simply makes the server binary available in that VM’s OS—it doesn’t magically expose it to your Mac unless you wire up networking. To use it from macOS you’ll need one of two setups:

1. **Bridged or Host‑Only Network**  
   Configure your UTM VM to use a bridged or host‑only adapter so the VM gets its own IP on your local LAN (or an internal subnet). Then on your Mac you can point your browser at `http://<VM‑IP>:3000/monitor`.

2. **Port Forwarding / SSH Tunnel**  
   If you stick with NAT networking, add a port‑forward in UTM (guest port 3000 → host port 3000), or SSH‑forward via something like:  
   ```bash
   ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 cory@<VM‑IP>
   ```  
   Then browse to `http://localhost:3000/monitor` on your Mac.

Once the VM’s Crabwalk server is reachable on your host network, you’ll get the live agent dashboard right in your Mac browser.
user: [Telegram Cory Stoner id:8471523294 +6m 2026-02-03 13:18 UTC] Do you have a X (Twitter) browser feature?
[message_id: 259]
assistant: [[reply_to:259]]  
We don’t have a specialized “X/Twitter browser” built in, but you have two options:

1. **OpenClaw Browser Automation**  
   If you start (or restart) the OpenClaw gateway and attach a Chrome tab via the OpenClaw Browser Relay extension, you can drive X (twitter.com) with the `browser` tool—navigate, snapshot, click, search, etc.  
2. **Lightweight Fetch**  
   For simple reads (e.g. latest tweets or a profile page), you can use `web_fetch(url, extractMode)` to pull the page text or markdown without a full browser.

Let me know which approach you’d like to try (or if you’d rather explore a custom skill for deeper Twitter data extraction)!
user: [Telegram Cory Stoner id:8471523294 +4m 2026-02-03 13:23 UTC] can you coordinate a lightweight fetch? search for things regarding yourself openclaw. Research any new interesting skills we could incorporate or use
[message_id: 261]
assistant: [[reply_to:261]]  
I can run a lightweight web search to uncover new OpenClaw‐related skills, but our Brave Search API key isn’t configured yet—so the `web_search` tool isn’t available.  

Would you like to:  
1. Configure a Brave API key (set `BRAVE_API_KEY` or run `openclaw configure --section web`) so I can use `web_search`,  
2. Or fall back to driving a browser snapshot for targeted sites (e.g. ClawHub or GitHub),  
3. Or would you prefer another approach?

assistant: [[reply_to:263]]  
Great—let’s get your Brave Search API key set up. Please share the key (or let me know if you prefer running `openclaw configure --section web` yourself), and I’ll patch the Gateway config so we can kick off the `web_search` tool.

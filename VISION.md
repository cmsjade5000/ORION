# Vision

## The Promise
What this system exists to become over time.
What problem it ultimately solves for me.
What kind of relationship I want to have with it.

## What Success Looks Like
Observable outcomes.
How I know this system is working.
What “better than before” actually means.

## Constraints (Non-Negotiables)
Lines this system must never cross.
Values that outweigh convenience or capability.
Things I refuse to trade away, even for power.

## The Feel
How interacting with this system should feel day to day.
Emotional tone.
Pace, calmness, clarity, confidence.

## Anti-Goals
What this system is explicitly not.
What I am not trying to optimize for.
Failure modes I want to avoid.
